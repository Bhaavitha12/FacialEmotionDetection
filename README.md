# FacialEmotionDetection
Facial emotion detection from video using deep learning in python.
Facial expressions are a key component of human communication, conveying emotions that words
often cannot. This project aims to develop a python-based software system that detects and
quantifies emotions in real-time from video streams using computer vision and deep learning. This
project aims to bridge the gap between human emotions and AI, making sentiment-aware systems
more accessible and effective. The system leverages OpenCV and Dlib for face detection and CNNbased models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, DeepFace) trained on datasets like FER-2013 and AffectNet for
emotion classification. It processes video frames dynamically, extracting facial features and mapping
them to emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality. This technology
has applications in mental health monitoring, customer sentiment analysis, human-computer
interaction, and security systems. By enhancing AIâ€™s ability to interpret human emotions, it improves
user experiences in various fields. Challenges include variations in lighting, facial occlusions, and
cultural differences in emotional expressions. Real-time processing also requires optimizing deep
learning models for efficiency.
